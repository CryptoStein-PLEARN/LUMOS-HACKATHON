<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project


After conducting a thorough research, we found that youth lack the basic skills and knowledge to make financial decisions which means that there is a great need to promote financial capability among the young. Introducing financial literacy in a fun and a more engaging way through PLEARN could help youth minimise the costs incurred in managing their financial products, improve their financial safety net in the event of emergencies, and strengthen their financial security. The gap that exists between the amount of financial responsibility given to the young and their demonstrated ability to manage financial decisions and take advantage of financial opportunities, is rapidly widening. Unless significant action is taken to alter this and enable youth to make savvy financial decisions, financial illiteracy will remain an obstacle to youth’ financial security.
We know that most people think trying to earn more money is the trick to attaining financial freedom, while the real trick is to know how to make your money work for you. The rich know it is not how much you make but what you do with what you make.
PLEARN It is the only virtual board game for teaching financial literacy that is blockchain-based and allows players to play in order to learn how to manage their finances through investing, trading in the stock & crypto markets and buying real estate.




<!-- Problems -->
## :bomb: Problems
- Basic knowledge: 1 in 5 teens lacks a basic foundation to build on for financial literacy.

- Spending: Annual wasteful consumption of youth (under 39) is approximately $11.7 billion

- Managing: 74% of teens don’t feel confident about their financial education.

- Lack of sustainable finance literacy in school

- Millennials lack the basic skills needed to make savvy financial decisions suggest that there is a great need to promote financial capability among the young

- The gap between the amount of financial responsibility given to the young and their demonstrated ability to manage financial decisions and take advantage of financial opportunities, is rapidly widening. Unless significant action is taken to alter this, financial illiteracy will remain an obstacle to Millennials’ financial security and that is what we are trying to solve through PLEARN. 

<!-- Solution -->
## :woman_technologist: Solution

We intend to empower youth with strong financial literacy to be able to make savvy financial decisions through allowing participants to play PLEARN in order to learn how to manage their finances via its four pillars: real estate deals, trading deals, auction market deals, and ESG-relating project deals. The game has two phases; players vs environment and players vs players. Through the players' journey, they will be using three different tokens ; Ambition (AMBI), Stablecoin(USDC/USDT)and manifestation (MANI). 

**A Blockchain based-platform**

**- Integrates:** NFT, real estate, and auction marketplace 

**Gamification**

**- Designs:** optimal UI, interactive, and creative learning activities through gaming in P2E, P2P, socialisation modes 

**Built in Metaverse**

**- Interoperability:** reflecting the real world activities such as social interactions, lifelike experience, and new opportunities for financial gains

As first step of developing the game, we will start with developing the first pillar; the Real Estate.

**Real-Estate deals Properties**

Contains deals relating to buying (minted) and renting (unminted) of virtual lands and properties.

 **- Commission to Land/property owner**

    Land is owned by a landowner if it has been bought. The landowner may choose to hold the property or rent it out, for doing so, they may extract a         commission, in which case this is deducted automatically. By default, the commission is set to 10% on all Land NFTs and this is configurable by the landowner.

**- Modifications to Land NFTs**
   - Ability to ‘name’ land
   - Ability to sell advertising links on land
   - Ability to change Land Rating with
   - Ability to rent it out and sell it back


**- Public Property**
the assets which belong to the game, which help game providers to supply the resources and facility to support the users to build their network, connect with the experts, and reuse the knowledge.

 **- Private Property**
The assets which users can buy land and build their own properties (coffee shops, car producers)

  **- Commission to Land/property owner**
Land is owned by a landowner if it has been bought. The landowner may choose to hold the property or rent it out, for doing so, they may extract a commission, in which case this is deducted automatically. By default, the commission is set to 20% on all Land NFTs and this is configurable by the landowner.

  2- AWS:
    
     - The varities AWS provide in terms of tools, databases and products,creates a difficulty in choosing the right tool for the project.
       Solution: We start with databases relating to the environment topics, which can narrow down the confusion and timing.

#### Game's Dynamics: 

![x_gJH7jyw9_SBu2f8XUsmJz_8S2CjKPM9-t7_8gUX9GxKe5Q7oakzhFV3sOAwix7Oxu82uhzugYPKcChFllFLjpUY0Yod5UpBgBiLvO_nqXJK7u6sBkcC3HcrPEN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107268440/193425187-3c618e03-b63f-4ebe-a24c-5f714ac7bee9.png)

#### Stages of a proposal

#### Game’s style
The idea of the game is a type of set collecting, where users collect assets (real estate, stocks, auction deals) to gain end-game goals.

#### Game’s setting:
 Multiplayers setting on one board
   

#### End-game goals Knowledge:
Users need to pass an amount of challenges to prove their knowledge and skills. Networking: users are required to get connected with an amount of other users in their network and build the knowledge hubs throughout the cities. Educational level Player is required to move till the end of the board to unlock the PvP mode. The game’s theme 26 boards are designed under 26 European Schengen country themes. Each board includes 14 tiles designed as cities/towns belonging to relevant countries.

#### Game Components
Game Components Digital board 1 dice Trading access cards Auction access cards
    

#### Game Setup:
 Connect Wallet:Sign-up option required by email, then the users can connect their MetaMask Wallet. Currency in game: users will need to convert their fiat into USDT in case they do not own USDT, otherwise, they can deposit their USDT into the platform and then buy AMBI token to start playing the game. Avatar: is the profile of users, which is NFT, users can add their own NFT into the game, or mint a new one directly on the platform. Fees: players will be paying fees for each transaction they make( the percentage is to be identified)

#### Game Phases:
Phase 1 PvE (Players vs Environment): in this phase players will be playing against the environment, so, there will be no interaction with other players. Phase 2: PvP (Player vs Player): players will interact with each other. This mode will be unlocked after the player finishes PvE mode. Once players arrive in this phase, they will be able to buy & sell between each other.

#### Challenges we ran into
We are facing the challenges of transferring the technology from Web 2 to Web 3. Our biggest challenge was the FNFT smart contrats, as this subbject is new to the team, we were facing some difficulties in building smart contracts, however, witht the support and the collaboration between team members, we were able to overcome this issue.

#### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The collaboration of the team made achieving the milestones of the project in a short period of time and within the deadline feasible. 

#### What we learned
We have learned about the GameFi market, the Web 3 ecosystem, and how to integrate blockchain in the educational model in a fun and interactive way to create a useful product. 

#### What's next for PLEARN?
**PLEARN**,as it has four pillars, and now, we are building the first pillar, the real estate, we are in the process of builiding the other three pillars, Tradinf, Auction, and ESG, so that the game can be complete.

---
### Token Model 

**Phase1:**

- AMBI(utility token): for playing and paying transaction fees
- Players will choose the deal which according to their analysis will help them generate passive income, accumulate wealth, and maximize their portfolio to be able to upgrade to PHASE 2.
- In PHASE 1, we use an already existed stable coin, for example (USDT, USDC…etc).

**Phase2:** 
- 2 other tokens will be added in the next stage: 1- Stable coin(USDC/USDT): paying interest for staking (locking a certain amount of money for a certain period of time and gaining interest)
- In later stages will be used as a borrowing token, in case players would like to leverage and buy more assets. Meaning that, they can borrow this token in order to be able to buy more assets or make big deals in the games.

- MANIFESTATION (MANI)- governance token:
    - Obtained(gained) through voting and submitting proposals!
    - Proposals: Players will be asked to submit suggestions in order to improve the game. 
    - Players will be given a certain period of time to submit their suggestions. After that, players will be voting for those suggestions.
    - The winning player whose suggestion got the highest number of votes will be rewarded for his winning suggestion (as a way to encourage them to    submit suggestions and participate in the voting process for them). 
    - This way the game will be improved by its users' suggestions, and they will be rewarded for their own suggestions (win-win situation). 
    - Control of MANI will enable the gaming community to influence decision making of the PLEAERN development team. Holders will be able to influence game economics (i.e. inflation rates), asset release schedules, game direction, and will otherwise provide some degree of ownership in development decision making.
