## :star2: About the Project

<img width="371" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107268440/193422781-2104cc8a-1243-414a-a273-d995c3239577.png">

After conducting a thorough research, we found that youth lack the basic skills and knowledge to make financial decisions which means that there is a great need to promote financial capability among the young. Introducing financial literacy in a fun and a more engaging way through PLEARN could help youth minimise the costs incurred in managing their financial products, improve their financial safety net in the event of emergencies, and strengthen their financial security. The gap that exists between the amount of financial responsibility given to the young and their demonstrated ability to manage financial decisions and take advantage of financial opportunities, is rapidly widening. Unless significant action is taken to alter this and enable youth to make savvy financial decisions, financial illiteracy will remain an obstacle to youth’ financial security.
We know that most people think trying to earn more money is the trick to attaining financial freedom, while the real trick is to know how to make your money work for you. The rich know it is not how much you make but what you do with what you make.
PLEARN It is the only virtual board game for teaching financial literacy that is blockchain-based and allows players to play in order to learn how to manage their finances through investing, trading in the stock & crypto markets and buying real estate.




<!-- Problems -->
## :bomb: Problems
- Basic knowledge: 1 in 5 teens lacks a basic foundation to build on for financial literacy.

- Spending: Annual wasteful consumption of youth (under 39) is approximately $11.7 billion

- Managing: 74% of teens don’t feel confident about their financial education.

- Lack of sustainable finance literacy in school

- Millennials lack the basic skills needed to make savvy financial decisions suggest that there is a great need to promote financial capability among the young

- The gap between the amount of financial responsibility given to the young and their demonstrated ability to manage financial decisions and take advantage of financial opportunities, is rapidly widening. Unless significant action is taken to alter this, financial illiteracy will remain an obstacle to Millennials’ financial security and that is what we are trying to solve through PLEARN. 

<!-- Solution -->
## :woman_technologist: Solution

We intend to empower youth with strong financial literacy to be able to make savvy financial decisions through allowing participants to play PLEARN in order to learn how to manage their finances via its four pillars: trading deals, real estate deals, auction market deals, and ESG-relating project deals. The game has two phases; players vs environment and players vs players. Through the players' journey, they will be using three different tokens ; Ambition (AMBI), Stablecoin(USDC/USDT)and manifestation (MANI). 

**A Blockchain based-platform**

**- Integrates:** NFT, real estate, and auction marketplace 

**Gamification**

**- Designs:** optimal UI, interactive, and creative learning activities through gaming in P2E, P2P, socialisation modes 

**Built in Metaverse**

**- Interoperability:** reflecting the real world activities such as social interactions, lifelike experience, and new opportunities for financial gains

  1- Airdrops:
    
      - Solution: We have used chainlink to automate the "airdrop" function of the smart contracts
    
  2- AWS:
    
     - The varities AWS provide in terms of tools, databases and products,creates a difficulty in choosing the right tool for the project.
       Solution: We start with databases relating to the environment topics, which can narrow down the confusion and timing.

<!-- Features -->
## :dart: Features

#### ESGROW Participation conditions

- Participation is open to the public and anyone who has an ESG-related idea and thinks that it could become a succeful project can participate and submit it
- Each participant will be allowed to submit only one project 
- Maximum number of accepted projects is 50 
- Community will vote to choose 10 out of 50 projects
- Each token holder has 2 votes
- Batches: 3-4 batches/year

#### Process: 

- Ideas: people submit their projects
- Voting: community votes 
- NFT: Minting NFT for the winning projects
- Funding: get funds through  the NFT marketplace


---
#### Stages of a proposal

**1- Proposals**
People can submit their idea/project through a form.

 **Form:**
   - Name of the projects
   - ESG category
   - Brief description of the idea 
   - Link to the main documents

**2- Voting**
- Projects will be subject to the community voting system. Community members, once the projects are submitted and after the submission period, will be able to check all the projects and start voting. Each community member will only have two votes; meaning that they can only vote for a maximum of two projects or can vote twice for the same project. Transferring tokens are not allowed during the voting process.

**Results announcement**
- After the voting period deadline, the number of votes will be displayed on the dashboard so all community can see the results and winning projects
- Winners will be invited to an interview with ESGROW team to introduce themselves
- NFT will be minted for the winning projects to represent the idea of the project
- This NFT will be fractionalized.
- NFT will be listed in the marketplace
- Some of the NFT fractions will be distributed to community members who have voted for the winning projects


**NFT Fractionalization features for the winning project**:

--Liquidity
--Ultimate price

**Funding**:
- Funding projects will be split into 3 phases:
- 30% to fund the project’s first phase 
- 40% to fund the project’s second phase
- 30% to fund the project’s 3rd and last phase

#### Challenges we ran into
We are facing the challenges of transferring the technology from Web 2 to Web 3. Our biggest challenge was the FNFT smart contrats, as this subbject is new to the team, we were facing some difficulties in building smart contracts, however, witht the support and the collaboration between team members, we were able to overcome this issue.

#### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The collaboration of the team made achieving the milestones of the project in a short period of time and within the deadline feasible. 

#### What we learned
We have learned about the GameFi market, the Web 3 ecosystem, and how to integrate blockchain in the educational model in a fun and interactive way to create a useful product. 

#### What's next for PLEARN?
**PLEARN**,as it has four pillars, and now, we are building the first pillar, the real estate, we are in the process of builiding the other three pillars, Tradinf, Auction, and ESG, so that the game can be complete.

---
### GOVERNANCE 

 **Governance Token**
 
   - **MANI**: is the governance token of the main project, **PLEARN ( PLAY.LEARN.EARN)**
     Users can acquire MANI either through buying it directly from the platform, or through the completion of the learning process when they play PLEARN.
     Only users who hold MANI can participate in submitting/voting process. We will airdrop users with two tokens in order to partipiate in both the submission and the voting process. However, these tokens can be used to vote twice, including their own project.
