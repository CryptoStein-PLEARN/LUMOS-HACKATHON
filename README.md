## :star2: About the Project

<img width="371" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107268440/193422781-2104cc8a-1243-414a-a273-d995c3239577.png">

After conducting a thorough research, we found that youth lack the basic skills and knowledge to make financial decisions which means that there is a great need to promote financial capability among the young. Introducing financial literacy in a fun and a more engaging way through PLEARN could help youth minimise the costs incurred in managing their financial products, improve their financial safety net in the event of emergencies, and strengthen their financial security. The gap that exists between the amount of financial responsibility given to the young and their demonstrated ability to manage financial decisions and take advantage of financial opportunities, is rapidly widening. Unless significant action is taken to alter this and enable youth to make savvy financial decisions, financial illiteracy will remain an obstacle to youth’ financial security.
We know that most people think trying to earn more money is the trick to attaining financial freedom, while the real trick is to know how to make your money work for you. The rich know it is not how much you make but what you do with what you make.
PLEARN It is the only virtual board game for teaching financial literacy that is blockchain-based and allows players to play in order to learn how to manage their finances through investing, trading in the stock & crypto markets and buying real estate.




<!-- Problems -->
## :bomb: Problems
- Basic knowledge: 1 in 5 teens lacks a basic foundation to build on for financial literacy.

- Spending: Annual wasteful consumption of youth (under 39) is approximately $11.7 billion

- Managing: 74% of teens don’t feel confident about their financial education.

- Lack of sustainable finance literacy in school

- Millennials lack the basic skills needed to make savvy financial decisions suggest that there is a great need to promote financial capability among the young

- The gap between the amount of financial responsibility given to the young and their demonstrated ability to manage financial decisions and take advantage of financial opportunities, is rapidly widening. Unless significant action is taken to alter this, financial illiteracy will remain an obstacle to Millennials’ financial security and that is what we are trying to solve through PLEARN. 

<!-- Solution -->
## :woman_technologist: Solution

We intend to empower youth with strong financial literacy to be able to make savvy financial decisions through allowing participants to play PLEARN in order to learn how to manage their finances via its four pillars: trading deals, real estate deals, auction market deals, and ESG-relating project deals. The game has two phases; players vs environment and players vs players. Through the players' journey, they will be using three different tokens ; Ambition (AMBI), Stablecoin(USDC/USDT)and manifestation (MANI). 

**A Blockchain based-platform**

**- Integrates:** NFT, real estate, and auction marketplace 

**Gamification**

**- Designs:** optimal UI, interactive, and creative learning activities through gaming in P2E, P2P, socialisation modes 

**Built in Metaverse**

**- Interoperability:** reflecting the real world activities such as social interactions, lifelike experience, and new opportunities for financial gains

  1- Airdrops:
    
      - Solution: We have used chainlink to automate the "airdrop" function of the smart contracts
    
  2- AWS:
    
     - The varities AWS provide in terms of tools, databases and products,creates a difficulty in choosing the right tool for the project.
       Solution: We start with databases relating to the environment topics, which can narrow down the confusion and timing.

<!-- Game's Dynamics -->
#### Game's Dynamics: 

![x_gJH7jyw9_SBu2f8XUsmJz_8S2CjKPM9-t7_8gUX9GxKe5Q7oakzhFV3sOAwix7Oxu82uhzugYPKcChFllFLjpUY0Yod5UpBgBiLvO_nqXJK7u6sBkcC3HcrPEN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107268440/193425187-3c618e03-b63f-4ebe-a24c-5f714ac7bee9.png)

#### Stages of a proposal

**Game’s style**
The idea of the game is a type of set collecting, where users collect assets (real estate, stocks, auction deals) to gain end-game goals.

 **Game’s setting:**
 Multiplayers setting on one board
   

**End-game goals Knowledge:**
Users need to pass an amount of challenges to prove their knowledge and skills. Networking: users are required to get connected with an amount of other users in their network and build the knowledge hubs throughout the cities. Educational level Player is required to move till the end of the board to unlock the PvP mode. The game’s theme 26 boards are designed under 26 European Schengen country themes. Each board includes 14 tiles designed as cities/towns belonging to relevant countries.

**Game Components**
Game Components Digital board 1 dice Trading access cards Auction access cards
    

**Game Setup:**
 Connect Wallet:Sign-up option required by email, then the users can connect their MetaMask Wallet. Currency in game: users will need to convert their fiat into USDT in case they do not own USDT, otherwise, they can deposit their USDT into the platform and then buy AMBI token to start playing the game. Avatar: is the profile of users, which is NFT, users can add their own NFT into the game, or mint a new one directly on the platform. Fees: players will be paying fees for each transaction they make( the percentage is to be identified)

**Game Phases:** Phase 1 PvE (Players vs Environment): in this phase players will be playing against the environment, so, there will be no interaction with other players. Phase 2: PvP (Player vs Player): players will interact with each other. This mode will be unlocked after the player finishes PvE mode. Once players arrive in this phase, they will be able to buy & sell between each other.

#### Challenges we ran into
We are facing the challenges of transferring the technology from Web 2 to Web 3. Our biggest challenge was the FNFT smart contrats, as this subbject is new to the team, we were facing some difficulties in building smart contracts, however, witht the support and the collaboration between team members, we were able to overcome this issue.

#### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The collaboration of the team made achieving the milestones of the project in a short period of time and within the deadline feasible. 

#### What we learned
We have learned about the GameFi market, the Web 3 ecosystem, and how to integrate blockchain in the educational model in a fun and interactive way to create a useful product. 

#### What's next for PLEARN?
**PLEARN**,as it has four pillars, and now, we are building the first pillar, the real estate, we are in the process of builiding the other three pillars, Tradinf, Auction, and ESG, so that the game can be complete.

---
### GOVERNANCE 

 **Governance Token**
 
   - **MANI**: is the governance token of the main project, **PLEARN ( PLAY.LEARN.EARN)**
     Users can acquire MANI either through buying it directly from the platform, or through the completion of the learning process when they play PLEARN.
     Only users who hold MANI can participate in submitting/voting process. We will airdrop users with two tokens in order to partipiate in both the submission and the voting process. However, these tokens can be used to vote twice, including their own project.
